# Portfolio
This is a web portfolio about me and my projects built with Bootstrap and HTML/CSS.

## Purpose
I wanted to create a web portfolio to showcase my web development abilities while also integrating more information about me and some of the projects I have developed throughout my programming career. This project has also been a great way to continue to expand my experience with Git and create projects in other languages as well.
